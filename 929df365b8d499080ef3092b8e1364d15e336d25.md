#Router

Next we import Router, render it, and render our Route Components as children. All thatâ€™s left is to add a path prop to each child.

```javascript
import { Link, Router } from "@reach/router";

// under the `nav`
<Router>
  <Home path="/" />
  <Dashboard path="/dashboard" />
</Router>;
```
